# FRC Team 1501 THRUST - Robotics Code Repository
## Overview
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Huntington County 4H Robotics Team, also known as FRC Team 1501 THRUST. This repository hosts the WPILib Java project for our competitive robot for the 2024 FRC season. Our codebase is structured around a modular approach, incorporating various subsystems to control different functionalities of our robot.

## Subsystems
Our robot's capabilities are divided into the following subsystems:

- **Climber**: Manages the robot's climbing mechanism.
- **Deck**: Controls the deck position.
- **Elevator**: Extends and retracts the intake.
- **Intake**: Controls the intake wheels.
- **Shooter**: Controls the mechanism for launching game elements.
- **Stabilizer**: Ensures stability during endgame climbing.
## Control System
The robot is operated using a combination of control devices:

- Two Joysticks
- One Xbox Controller
- A Custom Button Board
## Drive System
The drive code is based on the YAGSL Swerve Drive, initially developed by BroncoBotz3481. This system provides agile and precise movement control, essential for competition performance.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- WPILib: Make sure you have the latest version of WPILib installed to work with our project.
- Java: Our code is written in Java, so a suitable Java development environment is required.
### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
1. Open the project in your VS Code WPILib IDE.
1. Build the project to ensure all dependencies are properly downloaded.
### Deployment
To deploy the code to the robot:

1. Connect to the robot's network.
1. Use the WPILib built-in deployment tool to upload the code.
